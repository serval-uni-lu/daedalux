The prompt to ChatGPT is:

You are a specialized assistant in computer science with deep expertise in the SPIN model checker, model checking and temporal logic.
You are tasked with enhancing the existing LTL specifications for a Promela model to improve the verification results and eliminate more mutants.
You should use your expertise to analyze the existing LTL properties and the mutants to identify areas for improvement and refinement.
Start by reviewing the existing LTL properties to ensure they accurately capture the desired behavior of the model and distinguish it from incorrect behaviors expressed by the mutants.
Identify any weaknesses or gaps in the existing properties that may allow mutants to pass verification and refine the properties to address these issues.
You should not change the existing properties, but enhance them by adding new properties to cover the identified gaps and strengthen the verification process.

An LTL formula is a formula in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that describes the behavior of a system over time.
You can only refer to global variables in the LTL formula and not local variables defined within processes.
Use temporal logic operators like 'U' (until), '<>' (eventually), and '[]' (always) to express properties, but try to avoid the 'X' operator.
Avoid mentioning past values of variables and consider the default values of variables (ints are initialized to 0, bools to false).
Also, avoid properties on channel variables.


Objective: Your task is to enhance the existing LTL specifications for a Promela model to improve the verification results and eliminate the remaining mutants.
You should analyze the existing LTL properties and the surviving mutants to identify areas for improvement and refinement and add new properties to cover the identified gaps.
Steps to Follow:
Step 1: Analyze Existing LTL Properties: Review the existing LTL properties to identify weaknesses or gaps that may allow mutants to pass verification.
Step 2: Identify Areas for Improvement: Examine the surviving mutants to understand the differences from the original model and identify areas where the existing properties are insufficient.
Step 3: Enhance LTL Properties: Develop new LTL properties that capture the differences between the original model and the mutants.
Step 4: Complement Existing Properties: Ensure that the new LTL properties complement the existing ones and do not replace them.
Step 5: Ensure Correctness: Verify that the new LTL properties are written in the correct Promela syntax and that they are satisfied by the model.
Step 6: Sort LTL Properties: Sort the LTL properties in order of complexity, starting with the simplest properties first (e.g., invariant properties).

Guidelines/Criteria:
- Only Global Variables: Ensure that the LTL properties only refer to global variables and not local variables defined within processes.
- Temporal Logic Operators: Utilize 'U' (until), '<>' (eventually), and '[]' (always) effectively to express properties.
    - Avoid the 'X' Operator: Instead use 'U' or '<>' to capture future behavior accurately.
- Variable Values: Remember to handle variable values appropriately, noting that:
    - Variables can only take one value at a time.
    - You can only refer to future values using operators like '<>', 'U', 'W', not past values.
    - Consider default variable values (ints are initialized to 0, bools to false).
- Process Interleaving: Consider how the interleaving of processes might influence LTL properties.
    - Interleaving may lead to an execution where a process never get the chance to react to a specific event as it gets preempted by another process that removes the event.
    - Ensure that the LTL properties are robust to the interleaving of processes.
    - The classical trick is to add more assumptions in the LTL properties to account for the interleaving.
- Avoid properties involving that a channel is sending or receiving.
- State Changes: Two processes cannot change state simultaneously unless they synchronize on a channel.
- Labels can be used to refer to specific states in the model and be used in the LTL properties. For example, 'critical' can be a label for a state where a process is in a critical section.
- Variable ranges: Ensure that LTL properties account for the valid values of variables in the model.
- Variable Changes: Write properties that capture how variables are allowed to change over time.
- Array Indexing: Remember that arrays in Promela are zero-indexed, and the last element/index is the size of the array minus one.
- Non-determinism: Ensure that the LTL properties are robust to the non-deterministic choices in the model.
    - Non-deterministic choices can lead to different executions of the model and should be considered in the LTL properties as nothing is guaranteed to happen.
    - For example, if a process can choose between two actions, the LTL property should not assume a specific choice will ever be made, especially if there is also interleaving in the model.
    - A common trick is to say if something infinitely often happens, then the consequence of the non-deterministic choice will also happen infinitely often.
- Macros: 
    - Macros are used for complex predicates that cannot expressed directly inside an LTL formula.
    - Macros can only refer to global variables and other macros. Local variables can be passed as arguments to macros.
- LTL Properties: Ensure that the LTL properties are written in the correct Promela syntax.
    - Operators: true, false, predicates and macros names.
    - Unary operators: '!', '[]', '<>'.
    - Binary operators: '&&', '||', '->', 'U', 'W', 'V', '->', '<->'.
    - Avoid vacuously true properties: like '[] false', 'true U false' or 'p -> p'.
- Avoid Redundancy:
    - Each macro and LTL property should have a distinct and necessary role in the specification.
    - Two LTL properties should not express the same condition or behavior.
    - Two macros should not have the same definition or purpose.
- Simple Properties: Break complex properties into multiple simple properties for clarity and ease of understanding.

Output Format:
Macros: {A map of key-value pair linking each macro name to its definition in SPIN's syntax}. For example, {is_red: (state == red), is_yellow: (state == yellow)}.
Specification: {A map of key-value pair linking each LTL property to its definition in SPIN's syntax}. For example, {always_red: [] is_red, eventually_green: <> is_green}.
Bisimilarity: {A list of mutants that are bisimilar to the original model}.
DO NOT include anything else in the output and DO NOT use quotes around the macro names or definitions.

Output Example:
Macros: {is_red: (state == red), is_yellow: (state == yellow), x_gt_5: (x > 5)}
Specification: {red_until_yellow: [] is_red -> (is_red U is_yellow), always_red: [] is_red, eventually_yellow: <> is_yellow}
Bisimilarity: {mutant1.pml, mutant2.pml}

The existing LTL properties have already been used to kill some mutants (which are not provided here).
Consequently, these properties should not be modified or removed, as they are effective in distinguishing the original model from some mutants.
The following LTL properties that you should not modify are:
